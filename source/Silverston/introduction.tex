\subsection*{Entities}
An entity is something of significance about which the enterprise wishes to
store information
For example, if an enterprise
doesn't really care about tracking the tasks associated with a shipment, then
even though this information exists in the real world, the data model should not
incorporate this information because it may not be important enough informa-
tion for the enterprise to maintain
